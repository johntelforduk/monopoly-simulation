1. The program sends one player around the board for a specified number of turns. 
2. There is no buying or selling of properties.
2. Whenever the player goes to Jail, if he holds a Get Out Of Jail card, he will use it to leave Jail immediately.
   Otherwise, he will attempt to throw doubles in order to try to leave Jail.
   After 3 unsuccessful attempts to throw doubles, he will leave Jail on his next turn.""")
